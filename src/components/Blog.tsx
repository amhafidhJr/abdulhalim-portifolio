With the advent of Node.js, JavaScript can now be used on the server side as well. This means that developers can use a single language for both client-side and server-side programming, streamlining development processes and making it easier to build full-stack applications. Node.js provides a runtime environment that allows JavaScript to execute server-side scripts, handle HTTP requests, and interact with databases.\n    </p>\n    \n    <p>\n        The language is known for its rich ecosystem of libraries and frameworks that simplify and accelerate development.
